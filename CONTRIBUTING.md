## Building

Jan20 builds with [Gradle](http://gradle.org). 
You do not need to install Gradle to build the project, as Gradle can install itself.

To build, run this in the checkout:

    ./gradlew check

That will build the entire project and run all the tests.

### IDE import

The project is setup to work with IntelliJ IDEA.
Run the following in the checkoutâ€¦

    ./gradlew idea

Then import the project into IDEA or open the .ipr file.

If you use a different IDE or editor you're on your own.
